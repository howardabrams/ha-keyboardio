I'm quite pleased with my [[http://www.keyboard.io][keyboard.io Model 01]] keyboard (read [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Other/keyboardio-review.html][my review of the keyboard]]).

One of the best features is how /hackable/ this keyboard is, and this project
contains my customization code.  Note: Nothing here is unique or innovative, as
I simply grabbed existing libraries and put it together.

What is does:

  + The OneShot library to make the modifier keys /sticky/.
  + The LED Control library highlights when a modifier is /on/.
  + The prominent middle keys (=butterfly=, =led= and =any=) send various keys from a
    Keypad, that allows me to easily rebind them to cool functions.
